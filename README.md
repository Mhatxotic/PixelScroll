# Pixel Scroll

This small utility provides a toggleable drag and scroll mechanism for
macOS. It is especially useful with a trackball where you can press mouse
button 4 and roll the ball to scroll through a large website or a document.

## Installation

You may download the binary
[here](https://github.com/emreyolcu/pixel-scroll/releases/download/v0.1.0/PixelScroll.zip). It
runs in the background and does not interfere until mouse button 4 is pressed.

If you want this to run automatically at boot you may go to `System Preferences
> Users & Groups > Login Items` and add `PixelScroll` to the list. If you want
to undo the effect you may launch Activity Monitor, search for `PixelScroll`
and force it to quit.
