# Pixel Scroll

[Original](https://github.com/emreyolcu/pixel-scroll) version created by [Emre Yolcu](https://github.com/emreyolcu).

Forked, modified and modernised to a universal binary, icon and XCode project file.

This small utility provides a toggleable drag and scroll mechanism for
macOS. It is especially useful with a trackball where you can press mouse
button 5 and roll the ball to scroll through a large website or a document.

## Installation

You may download the binary
[here](https://github.com/Mhatxotic/PixelScroll/releases). It
runs in the background and does not interfere until mouse button 4 is pressed.

If you want this to run automatically at boot you may go to `System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items`
and add `PixelScroll` to the list. If you want
to undo the effect you may launch Activity Monitor, search for `PixelScroll`
and force it to quit.
